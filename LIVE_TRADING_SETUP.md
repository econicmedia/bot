# 🚀 Live Trading Setup Guide

This guide will help you transition from static mock data to functional paper trading with live market data.

## 📋 Current Status

Your AI Trading Bot currently displays static mock data. This guide will enable:

- ✅ **Live Market Data** from Binance
- ✅ **Paper Trading Execution** (no real money)
- ✅ **Real Strategy Signals** (ICT/SMC)
- ✅ **Live Dashboard Updates**
- ✅ **Functional Start/Stop Controls**

## 🔧 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Test Current Functionality
```bash
# Test the live trading system
python test_live_trading.py
```

### Step 2: Start Live Server
```bash
# Start the enhanced server with live data
python main_server_live.py
```

### Step 3: Access Dashboard
- Open: http://localhost:8000
- You should now see live market data and functional controls

## 📊 What's Changed

### Before (Static Mock Data)
- Hardcoded positions and trades
- Simulated price movements
- Non-functional start/stop buttons
- Static performance metrics

### After (Live Paper Trading)
- Real market prices from Binance
- Actual strategy signal generation
- Functional trading controls
- Live position and trade updates
- Real-time performance tracking

## 🔑 Credentials Configuration

### Current Setup (Safe for Testing)
The system is configured with demo credentials that work for paper trading:

```env
# .env file (already configured)
BINANCE_API_KEY=demo_api_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=demo_api_secret
BINANCE_SANDBOX=true
TRADING_MODE=paper
```

### For Enhanced Testing (Optional)
To get real market data, you can use Binance Testnet credentials:

1. **Create Binance Testnet Account**:
   - Go to: https://testnet.binance.vision/
   - Create account (free)
   - Generate API keys

2. **Update Credentials**:
   ```env
   BINANCE_API_KEY=your_testnet_api_key
   BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_testnet_secret
   BINANCE_SANDBOX=true  # Keep this true for safety
   ```
